GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically intended to permit
linking from non-(L)GPL-licensed software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public Licenses preserve the freedom to share and
change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU
General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the library or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
an opportunity for recipients to replace the library with a modified
version, under certain conditions.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free library. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
have designed this version of the LGPL to prohibit the practice for
those products.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the LGPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
  used in the Combined Work is called the "Linked Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or a work
  containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
  modifications and/or translated into another language.

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
  form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
  is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
  implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
  control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
  which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
  such as by intimate data communication or by critical algorithms
  dependent on shared routines. It also includes the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.

    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License and the complete Corresponding Source for the
    Library (and nothing else), including whatever changes were used in
    the Combined Work.

    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
    notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of
    the Corresponding Source described in this section.

    d) Do one of the following:

        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
           License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
           suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
           or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
           Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner
           specified by section 6 of the GNU General Public License for
           conveying Corresponding Source.

        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
           Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
           a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
           system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
           of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
           Version.

        2) Convey the Combined Work using the GNU GPL version 3, with the
           special exception described in this section, and offer to
           provide the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work under the
           terms of Section 3 of the GNU GPL for all parts of the Combined
           Work that are covered by that license.

        3) Provide installation information, but only if you would be
           required to provide such information under Section 6 of the
           GNU GPL version 3 for a corresponding Combined Work.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  the Library, but when linked with the Library this does not cause the
  resulting work to be covered by the GNU GPL, provided the other
  conditions of this section are met.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you must make a good faith effort to
  ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply that
  function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever
  part of its purpose remains meaningful.

  If the modification does not meet the requirement of the previous
  paragraph, then you may convey a non-source form of the Modified
  Version under the terms of Section 4, provided that you also convey
  the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
  License, and the Corresponding Application Code in the form defined
  in this License for a Combined Work.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
